#Exercise: Build a Model
1. Review the UML and ERD Materials in this module. 
2. Consider the problem of tracking student progress in course, and whether or not assignments are submitted on time. Develop the following: 
	- An ERD representing the data that needs to be stored
	- A class model with the classes and methods you might need in order to sustain this system. 
	- **You do not need to build a complete ERD, or a complete class model**. Two or three "boxes" in each is sufficient 
3. Submit you completed document in PDF Form on Canvas
