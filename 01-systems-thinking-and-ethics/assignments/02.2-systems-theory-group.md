***GROUP Assignment***

## Steps
1. Create a fork of the GitHub Repository at: https://github.com/chaoss/augur 
2. Follow the installation instructions for Augur here: https://github.com/chaoss/augur/blob/main/docs/new-install.md for a linux based computer or VM, or these instructions on OSX: https://github.com/chaoss/augur/blob/dev/docs/dev-osx-install.md 
 - Open an issue on the repository for any issues you encounter installing.
 - Star the repositories at https://github.com/chaoss/augur and https://github.com/oss-aspen/8knot 
 - Review Working versions of the interface in these locations: 
   - http://metrix.chaoss.io/
   - http://ai.chaoss.io/ 
   - [https://eightknot.osci.io/](https://eightknot.osci.io/) 
3. In your groups, discuss these perspectives on Augur as a system, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each user interface for the data gathered:
 - As a technical system
 - As a sociotechnical system for evaluating open source software project health and sustainability. 
 - As a sociotechnical system for 
    - Wholes Rather than parts  
    - Interconnections / Relationships   
    - Non-linear relationships    
    - Stock and flow relationships    
    - Dynamic Behavior    
    - Feedback loops  
    - Acknowledging that systems are important    
    - System as the cause of its behavior 
    - System structure generates behavior 
    - Delays
5. Summarize your discussions in a google doc, and submit that Google doc as a group.  You might consider using the [systems-perspectives](../readings/systems-perspectives.xlsx) spreadsheet as a "base" for initiating this activity. 
6. Submit a link to your google doc in Canvas by the deadline.
