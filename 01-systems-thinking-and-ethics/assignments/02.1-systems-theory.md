# Exercise 2.1 - Systems Theory
# CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
***Individual Assignment***

## Steps
1. Review each of the four articles on systems theory in the [readings](../readings)
2. ~~Review the lecture and slides from Tuesday~~ 
3. Consider one of these public cases where ethical boundaries were crossed (to varying degrees, depending on your perspective). 
 - A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit
 - Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret information about National Security Administration security and surveillance practices
 - Cambridge Analytica's use of fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential vote in the United States of America
4. For whichever case you chose, make a spreadsheet where the first column is "Ethical Quandry", and the subsequent columns are for listing individual systems affected. I want you to think about technical systems, as well as larger scale socio-technical systems. 
5. In each cell, place a checkbox for each ethical quandry that affected each system.
6. Write two paragraphs summarizing your grid. 
7. Commit your grid, and the summary to a GitHub repository (public or private) that GitHub user "sgoggins" can access. 
8. Submit a link to that repository in Canvas as your assignment.
