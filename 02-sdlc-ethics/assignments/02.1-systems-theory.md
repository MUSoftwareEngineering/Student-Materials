# Exercise 2.1 - Systems Theory
# CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
***Individual Assignment***

## Steps
1. Review each of the four articles on systems theory in the [readings](../readings/02-sdlc-ethics/readings.md)
2. Review the lecture and slides from Tuesday 
3. Consider one of these public cases where ethical boundaries were crossed (to varying degrees, depending on your perspective). 
 - A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit
 - Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret information about National Security Administration security and surveillance practices
 - Cambridge Analytica's use of fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential vote in the United States of America
4. For whichever case you chose, make a spreadsheet where the first column is "Ethical Quandry", and the subsequent columns are for listing individual systems affected. I want you to think about technical systems, as well as larger scale socio-technical systems. 
5. In each cell, place a checkbox for each ethical quandry that affected each system. Review class video from Tuesday to better understand the context for this action. 
6. Write two paragraphs summarizing your grid. 
7. Commit your grid, and the summary to a GitHub repository (public or private) that GitHub user "sgoggins" can access. 
8. Submit a link to that repository in Canvas as your assignment.
