This is a face to face class. 

AI Policy: The use of generative AI tools in this class is strongly encouraged. However, if you use an AI tool to help you generate responses, you must submit the URL pointing to the AI prompt and discuss alterations you made to the response. In addition, you are still responsible for the accuracy of the content you submit. In other words, you will still be penalized if the AI system generates inaccurate information. As such, you are required to double-check any output you use from the tools to make sure it is correct. We will be discussing this early on in the class.

**Points**: There are points assigned to each assignment in this course. We will divide your final score by the total number of points to arrive at your grade. Canvas *should* do this for us, but we always double check. You *should* see how you are doing as I submit grades. If you have any questions or concerns, please ask. 

_The syllabus and the course schedule will evolve based on student progress. We will never alter the syllabus for assignments in the past or percentage of the grade. Topics may be changed and assignments substituted as necessary. Please make sure you are looking at the current version of the syllabus from Canvas at all times.  Any changes will be announced in class as well._

## Meeting Schedule

Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2pm - 3:15pm

## Git and Github
1. Use this cheat sheet. You will need it. [CHEAT SHEET](./github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
2. Git and Github are TEAM oriented software engineering technologies. Teamwork is now organic to computing, programming, developing, designing, and many parts of life. 
 

## Participation in Class is Option, and TA Student Hours
1. **This course is project based. Your assignments will involve the routine submission of working code on GitHub.**
2. The first few weeks we will work through tooling issues with you, after that we expect you have learned how to use the slack channel and Google Each other. 
3. SLACK: Join. Participate. HELP EACH OTHER. Software Engineering is a team sport. Or an orchestra. The Tubas are not competing against the Drum Corps. They may be competing against the Trombones, but lets keep that off the field. 

### Expectations
See [README.md](../README.md)

My focus will be on ensuring you have the opportunity to understand and work with this course's curricula, and conclude your semester with a successful experience in this course regardless of the challenges we may face together. Learning to work effectively in software teams is a significantly different type of learning than mastering algorithms, data structures, or a particular language.  

## Course Prerequisites
 - _CS 2050CS 3380_
 - _Access to a non-Windows Operating System_: I am working on getting a Windows computer so I can be of more assistance to students running Windows 10.

2. Group Work
 - Feedback will be given as comments, issues and other forms of instructor contributions to your GitHub Repository
 - GitHub Repository Baseline Structure will be provided for Group Projects
3. Technology
 - You will need to identify a deployment environment:
  - Unix based Amazon EC2 Server
  - Postgres SQL as the Database Option 1
  - MongoDB as the Database Option 2
  - Flask : A Python Web Framework.
  - Python 3
  - Python Unit Testing Framework 

## Course Topics Resources
It is expected that students are proficient with performing basic web-based and Engineering Library http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/engineering/ searches for information. Throughout the semester, students will be assigned reading from the IEEE Computer Society's [_Software Engineering Body of Knowledge_:](./references/SWEBOKv3-Full.pdf)
- Short summaries of lecture topics may also be provided in place of the SWEBOK chapters.

## Course Policies

### Participation, out-of-class exercises and in-class quizzes
Mastery of these topics is achieved through execution of the software engineering process. The course material and exercise sequences are designed to build a foundation to participate in a team-oriented software engineering project successfully.

**There will be periodic short quizzes in this course**.  These will be announced in class during the session before each quiz. You must be current on your lecture notes, readings, and assignments from the week before each quiz. There will be, at most, 7 quizzes throughout the semester. You will not get credit if you are absent for a quiz.

Each exercise and lecture topic builds upon the concepts and lessons of the previous days and weeks, and therefore they are each critical to the progression of the class. The solution to each exercise will be provided and/or discussed after its due date. For this reason, **no late Exercises will be accepted**. All exercises are designed and intended to be an individual effort, _collaborative implementation or copying_ will result in a zero (0) on the exercise for all students involved. During lecture times, participation exercises and quizzes will be administered. These serve two purposes: to gauge the comprehension of the class regarding the recent lecture topics and concepts, and to survey lecture participation. **These participation events cannot be made up when missed, resulting in a zero (0) grade.**

### Exceptions due to outside factors
Exceptions will be made to the above policies for only the following conditions: a) illness or concern about your health; b) pre-absence email notification to the instructor regarding illness, family-related matters, career related matters. **WARNING:** information technology-related problems/failures/challenges are not appropriate excuses for late work. As a student in a senior-level Computer Science course, it is expected that you are capable of mitigating the risks associated with technology! **However, in the interest of providing you a real world experience, if you are running late, lets talk about how to change the scope.** I do allow resubmission. 

## Self Determination as a Learner

**Learning** is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and some machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is not compulsory; it is contextual. It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by what we already know. **To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.** Learning produces changes in the organism, which are relatively permanent.

_Psychology, 2nd edition_. pg. 264.
By Schacter, Gilbert, and Wegner (2009, 2011). Worth Publishers.

_As a learner (aka student) in a senior-level Computer Science course,_ _ **it is expected that you are capable of problem solving, Internet-based research, and constructing your own creative solutions** _ _to problems presented by the course. You must be a motivated, self-sufficient learner; applying your own creativity and problem solving skills to the work assigned as part of this class. The teaching assistants assigned to the course are strictly available to help you work through conceptual learning of the course material, not resolve your technology challenges or simply tell you the answers. It is imperative that you engage your mind and thought processes during your work in this course, else-wise you are depriving yourself the opportunity to grow as a learner._

## Graduate Student / Credit (CS 7320)
Students taking Software Engineering for graduate credit (CS 7320) will complete all the same work as the undergraduate students.  Additionally, graduate students will be assigned further reading assignments related to position papers and emerging research in the field of Software Engineering. You will compose papers (or presentations) that are either multi-article compare and contrast reviews or single article critiques. These writings will be counted as part of the 35% course grade that is allocated to _Writing Assignments_. Furthermore, graduate students will complete extra design and development related to the semester group project.

## Academic Dishonesty
- _Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. 
- All academic community members must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. 
- The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. 
- Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. 
- Consult the course instructor When you doubt plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating._

## ADA Notice
_Students with Disabilities:_
 - _If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of this course, if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need to make arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please let me know as soon as possible._

## Intellectual Pluralism
 - _The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may contact 
  - the Departmental Chair or Divisional Director; 
  - the Director of the_ Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities _(http://osrr.missouri.edu/); 
  - or the_ MU Equity Office _(http://equity.missouri.edu/), 
  - or by email at equity@missouri.edu. 
  - All students will be able to submit an anonymous evaluation of the instructor(s) at the end of the course._

## Recording Course Activities
 - _University of Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. __**In this class, students are not allowed to make audio or video recordings of course activity unless specifically granted permission by Dr. Goggins**__. However, the redistribution of audio or video recordings of statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of the faculty member and of any recorded students. Students found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline following provisions of Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters.__

## Decreasing the Risk of COVID-19 in Classrooms and Labs

We will follow University Policies as they evolve. We will also monitor local and campus statistics. If you are concerned about continuing in person, I welcome such discussions.
