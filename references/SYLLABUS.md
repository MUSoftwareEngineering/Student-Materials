# Syllabus
This is a face to face class. 

**Points**: There are around 1,000 points in this course. We will divide your final score by the total number of points to arrive at your grade. Canvas *should* to this for us, but we always double check. You *should* see how you are doing as I submit grades. If you have any questions or concerns, please ask. 

_The syllabus and the course schedule will evolve based on student progress. We will never alter the syllabus for assignments in the past or percentage of the grade. Topics may be changed and assignments substituted as necessary. Please make sure you are looking at the current version of the syllabus from Canvas at all times.  Any changes will be announced in class as well._

  - Dr. Sean P. Goggins  Email: [goggins@missouri.edu](mailto:goggins@missouri.edu) 

## Meeting Schedule

Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2pm - 3:15pm

## Git and Github 
1. Use this cheat sheet. You will need it. [CHEAT SHEET](./github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
2. Git and Github are TEAM oriented software engineering technologies. Teamwork is now organic to computing, programming, developing, designing, and many parts of life. 
 

## Participation in Class is Option, and TA Student Hours
1. **This course is project based. Your assignments will involve the routine submission of working code on GitHub.**
2. The first few weeks we will work through tooling issues with you, after that we expect you have learned how to use the slack channel and Google Each other. 
3. SLACK: Join. Participate. HELP EACH OTHER. Software Engineering is a team sport. Or an orchestra. The Tubas are not competing against the Drum Corps. They may be competing against the Trombones, but lets keep that off the field. JOIN SLACK CHANNEL NOW: http://bit.ly/software-eng-spring-2020 

### Expectations 
1. First, my basic expectations: For you to have viewed each course day's videos (short videos!), and any associated reading assignments prior to the scheduled lecture date. Again, **you are NOT required to be in the classroom, because there isn't one**. Keeping up with materials will be essential for keeping us “together” on our path. 
2. I will have student hours on zoom every week. We can discuss the times that work best in the coming weeks.  
3. The course will include discussion forums where you get to know each other, and discuss questions I pose for you in the assignments. 
4. You will have access to a Slack Channel, which will usually be the swiftest channel to get my attention on during the semester. Messaging systems like Slack are also usually more appropriate for team coordination work, when compared with more asynchronous tools like discussion forums. 
5. You will have routine "self assessments" in Canvas. They will not be a component of your grade, except that you will be required to complete them.  Your "score" replaces some of the feedback on how well you are understanding the material that I historically discern from confused looks in the classroom. But your "score" is not graded. Just completing the self assessment. 
6. Software engineering methods common in open source software are similar to those employed in corporate environments, and we will largely collaborate on open source projects. Some of my choosing, some of your own choosing.  All of this work will take place on GitHub, and be submitted as an assignment using Canvas. 
7. You have my personal commitment to creating a high quality learning opportunity for you, regardless of how you choose to participate. 


## Comments on Learning in the Present Day
People learn through a combination of social engagement with others, and enough cognitive stress to push you past what you already know, or think you know. While avoiding too much cognitive stress. Its important therefore that you take the time to engage with your course mates, and folks on teams you are assigned to work in for parts of the course. In the open source communities where I do research and contribute there is a lot of asynchronous coordination using GitHub issues, email lists, and Slack channels. Each group should make its own decisions about internal coordination mechanisms. 

Emotional stress also inhibits learning, and in present times many of us are affect by these types of "learning inhibitors". As your professor this semester, I am personally committed to respecting any stress/anxiety related, or other health challenges that get in your way this semester. 

My focus will be on ensuring you have the opportunity to understand and work with this course's curricula, and conclude your semester with a successful experience in this course regardless of the challenges we may face together. Learning to work effectively in software teams is a significantly different type of learning than mastering algorithms, data structures, or a particular language.  

## Course Prerequisites
 - _CS 2050CS 3380_
 - _Access to a non-Windows Operating System_: I am working on getting a Windows computer so I can be of more assistance to students running Windows 10.

## Course Procedural Matters
1. Work will be completed in a GitHub Repository you are assigned for the course or submitted via Canvas.
2. Group Work
 - Feedback will be given as comments, issues and other forms of instructor contributions to your GitHub Repository
 - GitHub Repository Baseline Structure will be provided for Group Projects
3. Technology
 - You will need to identify a deployment environment:
  - Unix based Amazon EC2 Server
  - Postgres SQL as the Database Option 1
  - MongoDB as the Database Option 2
  - Flask : A Python Web Framework.
  - Python 3
  - Python Unit Testing Framework 

## Course Topics Resources
It is expected that students are proficient with performing basic web-based and Engineering Library http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/engineering/ searches for information. Throughout the semester, students will be assigned reading from the IEEE Computer Society's [_Software Engineering Body of Knowledge_:](./readings/SWEBOKv3-Full.pdf)
- Short summaries of lecture topics may also be provided in place of the SWEBOK chapters.
- Additionally, IEEE, ACM and other open source papers providing thorough coverage of Software Engineering and the state of best practices will be assigned reading throughout the semester.

## Course Policies

### Participation, out-of-class exercises and in-class quizzes
Mastery of these topics is achieved through execution of the software engineering process. The course material and exercise sequences are designed to build a foundation upon which to successfully participate in a team-oriented software engineering project.

**There will be periodic short quizzes in this course**.  These will be announced in class during the session before each quiz. It is expected that you are current on your lecture notes, readings and assignments from the week prior to each quiz. There will be no more than five quizzes throughout the semester. If you are not present for a quiz you will not get credit.

Each exercise and lecture topic builds upon the concepts and lessons of the previous days and weeks, and therefore they are each critical to the progression of the class. The solution to each exercise will be provided and/or discussed after its due date. For this reason, **no late Exercises will be accepted**. All exercises are designed and intended to be an individual effort, _collaborative implementation or copying_ will result in a zero (0) on the exercise for all students involved. During lecture times, participation exercises and quizzes will be administered. These serve two purposes: to gauge the comprehension of the class regarding the recent lecture topics and concepts, and to survey lecture participation. **These participation events cannot be made up when missed, resulting in a zero (0) grade.**

### Exceptions due to outside factors
Exceptions will be made to the above policies for only the following conditions: a) illness or concern about your health; b) pre-absence email notification to the instructor regarding illness, family related matters, career related matters. **WARNING:** information technology related problems/failures/challenges are not appropriate excuses for late work. As a student in a senior-level Computer Science course, it is expected that you are capable of mitigating the risks associated with technology! **However, in the interest of providing you a real world experience, if you are running late, lets talk about how to change the scope.** I do allow resubmission. 

## Self Determination as a Learner

**Learning** is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and some machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is not compulsory; it is contextual. It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by what we already know. **To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.** Learning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are relatively permanent.

_Psychology, 2nd edition_. pg. 264.
By Schacter, Gilbert, and Wegner (2009, 2011). Worth Publishers.

_As a learner (aka student) in a senior-level Computer Science course,_ _ **it is expected that you are capable of problem solving, Internet-based research, and constructing your own creative solutions** _ _to problems presented by the course. You must be a motivated, self-sufficient learner; applying your own creativity and problem solving skills to the work assigned as part of this class. The teaching assistants assigned to the course are strictly available to help you work through conceptual learning of the course material, not resolve your technology challenges or simply tell you the answers. It is imperative that you engage your mind and thought processes during your work in this course, else-wise you are depriving yourself the opportunity to grow as a learner._

## Graduate Student / Credit (CS 7320)
Students taking Software Engineering for graduate credit (CS 7320) will complete all the same work as the undergraduate students.  Additionally, graduate students will be assigned further reading assignments related to position papers and emerging research in the field of Software Engineering. You will compose papers (or presentations) that are either multi-article compare and contrast reviews or single article critiques. These writings will be counted as part of the 35% course grade that is allocated to _Writing Assignments_. Furthermore, graduate students will complete extra design and development related to the semester group project.

## Academic Dishonesty
- _Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. 
- All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. 
- The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. 
- Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. 
- When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor._

## ADA Notice
_Students with Disabilities:_
 - _If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of this course, if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need to make arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please let me know as soon as possible._

## Intellectual Pluralism
 - _The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may contact 
  - the Departmental Chair or Divisional Director; 
  - the Director of the_ Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities _(http://osrr.missouri.edu/); 
  - or the_ MU Equity Office _(http://equity.missouri.edu/), 
  - or by email at equity@missouri.edu. 
  - All students will have the opportunity to submit an anonymous evaluation of the instructor(s) at the end of the course._

## Recording Course Activities
 - _University of Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and Regulations._ _ **In this class, students are not allowed to make audio or video recordings of course activity unless specifically granted permission by Dr. Goggins** __. However, the redistribution of audio or video recordings of statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of the faculty member and of any students who are recorded. Students found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters._

## Decreasing the Risk of COVID-19 in Classrooms and Labs

We will follow University Policies as they evolve. We will also monitor local and campus statistics. If you have a concern about continuing in person, I welcome such discussions.
