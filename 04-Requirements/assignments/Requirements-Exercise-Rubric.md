# Requirements Analysis CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
### Assignment 
In this exercise, you will perform a requirements analysis for an assignment submission service.
## Problem
- Need: A method for easily submitting and collecting programming assignments.
- Purpose: To create a system which allows students in programming classes to submit programming work. Additionally, the TAs must be able to collect assignments. Finally, the instructors need to be capable of managing the course, its sections, TAs, and assignments.
- Client Base: CS Department – faculty, staff, and students

## Deliverable
Create a document with a title page, including your name and the exercise name. Then complete the steps below, presenting the information in an organized fashion. When you are finished, one of you submit a PDF of your document to Canvas.

**Subtract a point (-1) for not including a title page with the required data.**

**NOTE: they do not have to present this step by step, if all the data is there**  

### Step 1  (5 points)

- Identify the different types of Users of the software system

5 – Lists at least Instructor, TA & Student  
3 – Misses any one of the above  
2 – Misses any two of the above  
1 – Gets none of the above, but at least lists more than one user  
0 – Doesn’t list any users  

### Step 2  (15 Points)

- **For each identified User**, identify the Activities they will perform with the software. (These are User Requirements.)

15 –  Lists Comprehensive and thoughtful activities.  For example, everything we foreshadowed, plus many activities that are commonly understood. [At least 3 activities per user]  
12 – Lists all the activities basically given to them in the assignment, plus a few additional that are thoughtfully included [At least 3 activities per user]  
8 – Only lists activities given in the assignment  [At least 2 activities per user]  
4 – One activity per user, and not that well thought out [1 activity per user]  
0 – Doesn’t list any activities   


### Step 3  (25 points)

- **For each identified Activity**, identify…  
  - relevant data within the system. Data entities and attributes may be simply listed or you may construct a data model if it helps.
  - constraints (non-functional) on the activity or the resultant state of the system

25 – All major logical attributes & constraints for each activity are accounted for (At least 5 data points per activity.)  
20 – Most attributes & constraints for each activity are accounted for (at least 4 data points per activity)  
15 – Many logical attributes & constraints for each activity are accounted for (at least 3 data points per activity)  
10 – Only a few attributes & constraints accounted for  
5 – No attributes for some activities  


### Step 4 (5 points)

- Identify System constraints and requirements
  - i.e. hardware and necessary components

5 – **System constraints** identified fully (or reasonably fully)  
3 – Misses a few minor constraints, or one or two listed are not system constraints
2 – Misses at least one significant constraint, or several listed are not system constraints
1 – Lists a few apparently random constraints  
0 – Doesn’t list any constraints
