# Individual Requirements Analysis

In this exercise, you will perform a requirements analysis for an Open Source Software Health and Sustainability Metrics Tool.

## Problem

With hundreds of thousands of open-source projects, technology companies and IT organizations are overwhelmed trying to assess which projects are most likely to be healthy and sustainable years from now. Yet, with the growing importance of real-time operating and safety-critical systems, it is inevitable that the need to make sustainability predictions about open-source projects more reliably will be central to the success of many technology-driven companies. How do we wade through this confusing morass?

- Augur: [chaoss/augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur)
- [Augur Community Reports:](https://github.com/chaoss/augur-community-reports) (Downloadable and runable Jupyter Notebooks)

### Augur Instances:

## Deliverable

Create at least one use case using the template provided, and identify at least 20 discrete requirements using the sample spreadsheet for requirements tracking provided.

```
NOTE: ## Deliverables confusion clarification from Discord 1. Complete the template specified in the requirements management process 2. Include at least 1 use case (Note I say “2” in the outline, and any time there’s a number discrepency the error is corrected in favor of demanding less. So its one), and 3. Identify at least 20 discrete requirements, using the sample spreadsheet for requirements tracking provided.
```

## Requirements Analysis Process
### Step 0
Make sure you understand the problem. You can ask questions in Discord and review the resources listed above.
Orient yourself to the structure and criteria of requirements specification success.

- [Slides](../slides)
- [Use Cases Slides](../slides)
- [SRS Examples One](../readings/SRS-Example-1.pdf) and [Two](../readings/SRS-Example-2.pdf)
- [Spreadsheet Example](./requirements-template.xlsx)

### Step 1
#### Create an outline for your software requirements specification in a document.
Include these sections:
- Introduction
- Software product overview (hint: Augur is a good place to start http://augur.osshealth.io)
- System Use, including an actor survey
- System Requirements (including 2 use cases, a system functional specification, and a list of non-functional requirements)
- Design Constraints (at least 5)
- Purchased Components (at least 1)
- Interfaces (at least 1)

### Step 2
- Begin Filling in the Sections
- View this as an iterative document. Do a piece at a time and reflect on the knowledge you gain while beginning work in teams.

### Step 3
**Submit your completed software requirements document by the assignment deadline.
