# The  Role  of  the  Customer

You  are  a  very  intelligent,  experienced,  capable  software  designer  and  developer  who consistently  produces  software  that  meets  or  exceeds  the  quality,  performance,  and functional  requirements  of  the  customer.   Because  of  this,  you  are  extremely  confident in  your  judgment   and  can   rarely  be  persuaded   to  look   at   alternatives   unless   an extremely sound  argument is presented.  You  have  the  uncanny  ability  to abstract  away from  the  details of  a  problem  and  design  a  system  that  not  only  solves  the  problem  but incorporates   cutting-edge   technology   and   innovative   features   into   the   solution. However, you  evolve a  design over  time  and  rarely write it  down  until you  must.   Not  all ideas come  at once, therefore, and sometimes  the ideas can  even  be general  and conflicting.    The  following  paragraphs  describe  your  general  requirements  for  the  delivered
software system.

The customer will advocate for what they "think" they want. In some respects they have the final say. In another respect, they generally understand what's needed in a system the least. High power, low knowledge.

## Why Create CHAOSS?

The importance of open source software is no longer in question. However, its importance raises important questions about the open source ecosystem. Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact. Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members. Open source companies want to know which communities and software to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source. Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.

In response to these issues, the CHAOSS community is developing metrics, methodologies, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability. By measuring open source project health and sustainability, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.

## What are CHAOSS Goals?

The project aims to:
1. Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health
2. Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development
3. Build reproducible project health reports/containers

## CHAOSS Roadmap

Who are we?

CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is organized in two committees and four working groups:
Committees
1. The Metrics Committee works on establishing implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health.
2. The Software Committee works on producing integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases.

## Working Groups

The goal of the working groups is to refine the metrics and to work with software implementations. The working groups are:
1. Diversity and Inclusion
2. Evolution
3. Common Metrics
4. Value
5. Risk
