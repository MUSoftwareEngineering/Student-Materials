## Requirements Brainstorming Activity 

### Steps in Lab
1. Review Materials (15 Minutes) 
    - [Review the Role of the customer](./customer.md)
    - [Read the customer statement of need (description on the CHAOSS and Augur Projects)](./customer-description.md)
    - Read the description of your assigned role. Having a software engineer, requirements analyst and user are sufficient, since your groups are of 3-4 people. 
        - [Customer](./customer.md)
        - [User 1](./user1.md)
        - [User 2](./user2.md)
        - [Requirements Analyst](requirements-analyst.md)
        - [Software Engineer](software-engineer.md)
2. Perform requirements elicitation using the brainstorming technique (See next section).

### Brainstorming Phase
Your group is to perform a requirements elicitation activity using the brainstorming technique. The goal is for the group to generate a set of requirements, written in English sentences, for the CHAOSS-Augur software
system.

You will be given 15 minutes to prepare. During this time, reread the description of your assigned role and start expanding on it. If you are the customer or a user, jot down your ideas about the requirements and expand upon the ideas in your role description.

You will have one hour to perform the brainstorming activities. Spend 20 minutes in the idea generation phase and 40 minutes in the consolidation phase.

Designate one person in the group to write down each complete idea on a single list.

### Consolidation Phase

During the consolidation phase, the requirements analyst reads through the list of requirements (ideas) one at a time. The entire group then classifies each requirement in two ways: 

- first by practical (good ideas that can be investigated immediately, ideas that need long range or involved study, and unusable ideas) and then 
- by priority (ideas that absolutely must be implemented, those that are desirable but not urgently needed, and those that should be added only if time and money permit). Any new ideas generated in this phase should be considered for addition to the final list


After you classify (score) the requirements as above, for the consolidation phase, be creative but phrase and classify the ideas in terms of requirements for the CHAOSS-Augur system. 

- If your ideas describe features, capture them in terms of functional requirements.
- If your ideas describe system performance and infrastructure features, and capture them as system requirements.
