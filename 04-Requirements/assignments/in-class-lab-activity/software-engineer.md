# Software Engineer

You are a software engineer on the  CHAOSS-Augur Project, hired to
perform high-level design of the system. You have been with the System Software Division in the the Linux Foundation for four years and were just brought on board the  CHAOSS-Augur Project last week. You have six years of software development experience in all; your first two years were spent writing application programs in the Applications Division at the Linux Foundation, which hired you directly from college. You were given a software design and development position on the current project as a result of your knowledge of CHAOSS-Augur system and the software design skills that you demonstrated on your last project, a software metrics tool for Open Source called "Grimoirelab".

You are a very methodical software designer and developer with a reputation for producing software systems that meet their specifications. You are very thorough, investigating every alternative design and weighing the benefits and risks associated with each. This gives you a reputation for working slightly slower than other engineers, but this is acceptable because you produce systems that work and that contain few errors.

You have read the statement of need supplied by the customer and have done some initial investigation, experimentation, and prototyping in Augur to answer questions that came to mind while reading it. You know that using Python increases the risk that web response times will be longer than is acceptable. You know that
there are Python library routines, accessible from Python programs, that will allow a program to create multiple, dependent subprocesses in a Python virtual environment. 

*Note: You are to use this role to guide your actions during the role-playing exercise. The
description provides only high-level guidance, however, and you are encouraged to
embellish the role using your own experience and the background materials provided to
you in this exercise.*
