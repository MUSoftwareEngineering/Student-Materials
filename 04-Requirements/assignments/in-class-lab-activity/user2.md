# User 2

You are a user for CHAOSS-Augur system. You are one of the software developers on the Project within the
Applications Division. You have been with the Applications Division for three years and with the Augur Project for about six months. You have five years of software development experience on large projects and were given a software development position on the current project as a result of demonstrating tremendous productivity and superior problem-solving skills on your last project.

You are a budding young software developer who shows much promise. You gained high marks in school in all of your software engineering classes. You were hired onto the CHAOSS-Augur project because of your high marks in school and because your two years of software development experience were with Java, on windows workstations running Apollo Mission Virtual Machines. The software that you produced on your last project adhered to the principles of software engineering you were taught in school, and the result was well-structured, well-documented code.

Because you lack software development experience in general, though, your code was not easily integrated with the rest of the system. However, your project manager has every confidence that your skills will improve as you gain experience. 

The project manager felt that you best represent the typical, intended user of the CHAOSS-Augur software system and asked that you participate in the requirements definition activities. With respect to the CHAOSS-Augur software system, you are concerned about maintaining a "GitHub" look and feel and supporting GitHub functionality. You would like to see GitHub commands and now they relate to metrics. 

You have many more thoughts about user interface requirements at lower levels of detail. For any question or discussion, your responses should be consistent with your own personal concepts regarding the CHAOSS-Augur software system.
