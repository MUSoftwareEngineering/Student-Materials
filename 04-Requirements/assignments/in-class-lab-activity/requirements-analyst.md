# Requirements Analyst

You are a requirements analyst for the CHAOSS-Augur Project in the System Software division. You have been with the company for seven years and with the CA Project since it began 2 years months ago. You have ten years of software development experience on large projects and two additional years of experience as a requirements analyst. You were given your current position on the CHAOSS-Augur Project as a result of demonstrating superior
communication and problem-solving skills on your last project, where you were the principle requirements analyst.

Your undergraduate degree is in computer science from the esteemed University of Misosuri, and you initially gained experience in programming by writing statistical analysis programs in Python for your assignments
in college. When you graduated from school, the job market was tight for genius computer programmers, but there were plenty of jobs for D&D players. 

Your first job was as a Python programmer in a shipping company. While you were there, you picked up
some limited experience with C. After three years of working with the shipping (like boats) company, your project delivered its software system and you were laid off because of a lack of available work. At that time, the CHAOSS-Augur project was entering full-scale development on three of its projects and hired you because of your C experience.

Over the next seven years, you were proficient and productive enough to continue to find work within CHAOSS-Augur. You learned javascript and gained much experience in both Python and Machine Learning. Over the years, however, you became more interested in the human aspects of software development and less interested in developing code. As a result, you enrolled in a program at the local university to obtain a master’s degree in behavioral psychology, and you are about to graduate. Two years ago you applied for and obtained a position as a systems analyst on a management information systems project within the Applications Division. You knew immediately that you had found a home. You became extremely productive because communicating with people was easy and fun, and you did it well. Your first project as a systems analyst was extremely successful in that the
delivered software met or exceeded every expectation of the customer and users. You were instrumental in the project’s success because you were able to get the customer and users to communicate their needs, and you captured an accurate understanding of them.

Your success inspired you to pursue more requirements-related work within the project;
you, therefore, learned some requirements elicitation techniques on your own.
With respect to the CHAOSS-Augur software system, all you know is what you have read
from the customer’s statement of need; you are, nevertheless, excited to get started on
this project. You plan to use one of the requirements elicitation techniques you know to
get started with gathering the requirements for CHAOSS-Augur. You are also confident that
your previous development experience will help you resolve technical conflicts that
might arise.

You are trying to think about issues related to the quality, consistency, coherence of the requirements.  Looking at them as a whole, do they fit into categories?
