# Exercise : Requirements Analysis CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
### Group Assignment using Course Group Set 2
In this exercise, you will perform a requirements analysis for an assignment submission service.
## Problem
- Need: A method for easily submitting and collecting programming assignments.
- Purpose: To create a system which allows students in programming classes to submit programming work. Additionally, the TAs must be able to collect assignments. Finally, the instructors need to be capable of managing the course, its sections, TAs, and assignments.
- Client Base: CS Department – faculty, staff, and students

## Deliverable
Create a document with a title page, including your group, group member names and the exercise name. Then complete the steps below, presenting the information in an organized fashion. When you are finished, one of you submit a PDF of your document to Canvas.

## Requirements Analysis Process  
### Step 0 
- Make sure you understand the problem. You can ask questions in the GitHub channel #requirements in Slack.  
### Step 1  
- Identify the different types of Users of the software system
### Step 2  
- **For each identified User**, identify the Activities they will perform with the software. (These are User Requirements.)
### Step 3  
- **For each identified Activity**, identify…  
  - relevant data within the system. Data entities and attributes may be simply listed or you may construct a data model if it helps.
  - constraints (non-functional) on the activity or the resultant state of the system  
### Step 4  
- Identify System constraints and requirements
  - i.e. hardware and necessary components


**NOTE: This may not be (should not be) the whole assignment, but gathering requirements in a list like this is something that may be helpful. You could convert this easily to a google spreadsheet for your group: https://github.com/MUSoftwareEngineering/CS-4320/blob/master/03-requirements/readings/requirements-template.xlsx** 

Spreadsheets, in general, are a good way to get started. Here's a Google Sheet template that may suite this assignment: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14G-Xpq22ll9G7EUUZpubZk1aojoDV8g09eaVVdjiS3I/edit?usp=sharing
